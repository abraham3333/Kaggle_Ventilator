# Ventilator Pressure Prediction Analysis

This repository contains the analysis and modeling of the Ventilator Pressure Prediction dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ventilator-pressure-prediction/data). The project involves comprehensive feature engineering, machine learning models, and a neural network model to predict ventilator pressure.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the pressure in a ventilator system using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The dataset consists of time-series data with features such as `u_in`, `u_out`, and other relevant parameters.

## Feature Engineering

Extensive feature engineering was performed to enhance the predictive power of the models. This includes:
- Interaction features (e.g., `u_in_x_u_out`)
- Polynomial features (e.g., `u_in_squared`)
- Cumulative features (e.g., `cumulative_u_in`)
- Statistical aggregation features (e.g., mean, std, min, max of `u_in` and `u_out`)

## Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models were implemented and evaluated, including:
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

Each model was tuned for optimal performance using cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization.

## Neural Network Model

A neural network model was also developed using TensorFlow/Keras. The architecture includes:
- Multiple dense layers with ReLU activation
- Dropout layers for regularization
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function

## Challenges with Google Colab

While working on this project, I encountered several challenges with Google Colab:
- Colab disconnected after long processing times, which interrupted the workflow.
- Due to memory constraints, I had to work with a smaller portion of the dataset.
- Running the analysis a second time was challenging due to these limitations.

## Results

The models were evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict the pressure values. The results indicate that both the machine learning models and the neural network model provide valuable insights, with the neural network showing promising results in capturing complex patterns.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of feature engineering and the application of various machine learning and deep learning models in predicting ventilator pressure. Despite the challenges faced with Google Colab, the analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and the predictive models.
